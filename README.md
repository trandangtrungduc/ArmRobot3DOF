# The Arm Robot 3 Degree of freedom

[//]: # (Logo)

### Overview
- This is a small project suitable for students who are studying majors such as mechatronics, electronics, automation, ... or research on arm robot at universities.
- Dependency: Matlab, Solidworkds.

### Implementation
1. Design 3 degrees of freedom robotic arm using Solidworks.
2. Calculation of kinematics.
3. Calculation of dynamics.
4. Simulation using Matlab and Simulink.
